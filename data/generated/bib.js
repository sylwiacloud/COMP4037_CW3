        "abstract": "We consider interval-valued data that frequently appear with advanced technologies in current data collection processes. Interval-valued data refer to the data that are observed as ranges instead of single values. In the last decade, several approaches to the regression analysis of interval-valued data have been introduced, but little work has been done on relevant statistical inferences concerning the regression model. In this paper, we propose a new approach to fit a linear regression model to interval-valued data using a resampling idea. A key advantage is that it enables one to make inferences on the model such as the overall model significance test and individual coefficient test. We demonstrate the proposed approach using simulated and real data examples, and also compare its performance with those of existing methods. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Aggregation of large databases in a specific format is a frequently used process to make the data easily manageable. Interval-valued data is one of the data types that is generated by such an aggregation process. Using traditional methods to analyze interval-valued data results in loss of information, and thus, several interval-valued data models have been proposed to gather reliable information from such data types. On the other hand, recent technological developments have led to high dimensional and complex data in many application areas, which may not be analyzed by traditional techniques. Functional data analysis is one of the most commonly used techniques to analyze such complex datasets. While the functional extensions of much traditional statistical techniques are available, the functional form of the interval-valued data has not been studied well. This article introduces the functional forms of some well-known regression models that take interval-valued data. The proposed methods are based on the function-on-function regression model, where both the response and predictor/s are functional. Through several Monte Carlo simulations and empirical data analysis, the finite sample performance of the proposed methods is evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

        "abstract": "When working with real-valued data regression analysis allows to model and forecast the values of a random variable in terms of the values of either another one or several other random variables defined on the same probability space. When data are not real-valued, regression techniques should be extended and adapted to model simply relationships in an effective way. Different kinds of imprecision may appear in experimental data: uncertainty in the quantification of the data, subjective measurements, perceptions, to name but a few. Compact intervals can be effectively used to represent these imprecise data. Set- and fuzzy-valued elements are also employed for representing different kinds of imprecise data. In this paper several linear regression estimation techniques for interval-valued data are revised. Both the practical applicability and the empirical behaviour of the estimation methods is studied by comparing the performance of the techniques under different population conditions.",

        "abstract": "We use the so-called \"bent-cable\" model to describe natural phenomena that exhibit a potentially sharp change in slope. The model comprises two linear segments, joined smoothly by a quadratic bent. The class of bent cables includes, as a limiting case, the popular piecewise-linear model (with a sharp kink), otherwise known as the broken stick, Associated with bent-cable regression is the estimation of the bend-width parameter, through which the abruptness of the underlying transition may be assessed. We present worked examples and simulations to demonstrate the regularity and irregularity of bent-cable regression encountered in finite-sample settings. We also extend existing bent-cable asymptotics that previously were limited to the basic model with known linear slopes of 0 and 1. Practical conditions on the design are given to ensure regularity of the full bent-cable estimation problem if the underlying bend segment has nonzero width. Under such conditions, the least-squares estimators are shown to be consistent and to asymptotically follow a multivariate normal distribution. Furthermore, the deviance statistic (or the likelihood ratio statistic, if the random errors are normally distributed) is shown to have an asymptotic chi-squared distribution. \u00a9 2006 American Statistical Association.",

The method is based on the symmetrical linear regression methodology such that the prediction of the lower and upper bounds of the interval value of the dependent variable is not damaged by the presence of interval-valued data outliers. The method considers mid-points and ranges of the interval values assumed by the variables in the learning set. The prediction of the boundaries of an interval is accomplished through a combination of predictions from mid-point and range of the interval values. The evaluation of the method is based on the average behavior of a pooled root mean-square error. Experiments with real and simulated symbolic interval data sets demonstrate the usefulness of this symbolic symmetrical linear regression method. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The relationship between an interval-valued response variable and a set of interval-valued explanatory variables is investigated by considering two regression models, one for the midpoints and the other one for the radii. The estimation problem is approached by introducing Lasso-based constraints on the regression coefficients. This can improve the prediction accuracy of the model and, taking into account the nature of the constraints, can sometimes produce a parsimonious model with a common subset of regression coefficients for the midpoint and the radius models. The effectiveness of our method, called Lasso-IR (Lasso-based Interval-valued Regression), is shown by a simulation experiment and some applications to real data. \u00a9 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "Most of statistics and AI draw insights through modeling discord or variance between sources (i.e., intersource) of information. Increasingly however, research is focusing on uncertainty arising at the level of individual measurements (i.e., within- or intrasource), such as for a given sensor output or human response. Here, adopting intervals rather than numbers as the fundamental data-type provides an efficient, powerful, yet challenging way forward - offering systematic capture of uncertainty-at-source, increasing informational capacity, and ultimately potential for additional insight. Following progress in the capture of interval-valued data in particular from human participants, conducting machine learning directly upon intervals is a crucial next step. This article focuses on linear regression for interval-valued data as a recent growth area, providing an essential foundation for broader use of intervals in AI. We conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art methods, elucidating their behavior, advantages, and pitfalls when applied to synthetic and real-world datasets with different properties. Specific emphasis is given to the challenge of preserving mathematical coherence, i.e., models maintain fundamental mathematical properties of intervals. In support of real-world applicability of the regression methods, we introduce and demonstrate a novel visualization approach, the interval regression graph (IRG), which effectively communicates the impact of both position and range of variables within the regression models - offering a leap in their interpretability. Finally, this article provides practical recommendations concerning regression-method choice for interval data and highlights remaining challenges and important next steps for developing AI with the capacity to handle uncertainty-at-source.  \u00a9 2020 IEEE.",
