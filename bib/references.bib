  abstract = {Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},

	abstract = {Most of statistics and AI draw insights through modeling discord or variance between sources (i.e., intersource) of information. Increasingly however, research is focusing on uncertainty arising at the level of individual measurements (i.e., within- or intrasource), such as for a given sensor output or human response. Here, adopting intervals rather than numbers as the fundamental data-type provides an efficient, powerful, yet challenging way forward - offering systematic capture of uncertainty-at-source, increasing informational capacity, and ultimately potential for additional insight. Following progress in the capture of interval-valued data in particular from human participants, conducting machine learning directly upon intervals is a crucial next step. This article focuses on linear regression for interval-valued data as a recent growth area, providing an essential foundation for broader use of intervals in AI. We conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art methods, elucidating their behavior, advantages, and pitfalls when applied to synthetic and real-world datasets with different properties. Specific emphasis is given to the challenge of preserving mathematical coherence, i.e., models maintain fundamental mathematical properties of intervals. In support of real-world applicability of the regression methods, we introduce and demonstrate a novel visualization approach, the interval regression graph (IRG), which effectively communicates the impact of both position and range of variables within the regression models - offering a leap in their interpretability. Finally, this article provides practical recommendations concerning regression-method choice for interval data and highlights remaining challenges and important next steps for developing AI with the capacity to handle uncertainty-at-source.  © 2020 IEEE.},
